# Navel_Biodiversity

Its amazing what you can learn from data, and how it can be represented!

This data set samples the biome of the belly button of a group of subjects. The subjects also reported the number of times per week they cleaned out that navel.

Does the frequency of scrubs correlate to the yucky stuff in a person's navel? It doesn't seem to appear that way, but using Plotly, we displayed the data for each research participant in interesting ways.
